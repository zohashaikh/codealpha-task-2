This business card was designed as part of my internship, focusing on creating a professional and memorable visual identity for a mock company. The design utilizes Adobe Illustrator and Canva, and follows the principles of minimalism and effective typography to ensure a sleek and modern look.

Key features of the design:

Clean typography that highlights essential contact information.
A sophisticated color palette to reflect the brand's identity.
A subtle background pattern for added visual interest without overpowering the content.
Use of gradients and mini icons to enhance the card's appeal and functionality.
The business card is designed to leave a lasting impression while maintaining clarity and professionalism, aligning with the company's brand identity.
